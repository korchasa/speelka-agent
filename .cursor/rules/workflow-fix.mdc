# WORKFLOW
1. Enable Autonomous mode
2. Read existing documentation in `./documents`.
3. Use the project check protocol to detect errors.
4. Analyze errors by reviewing logs and stack traces if they exist.
5. Isolate failing tests to focus on the specific issues.
6. Study the tests to understand the expected behavior.
7. Review relevant code sections and documentation.
8. Reproduce the issue using a minimal example.
9. Formulate and test hypotheses incrementally, documenting each step.
10. Apply minimal necessary changes to fix the error once confirmed.
11. Check the project at the end to confirm the absence of errors. If errors exist, go to step 4.
12. STOP
