# TESTS FIX ALGORITHM
1. Analyze errors by reviewing logs and stack traces if they exist.
2. Isolate failing tests to focus on the specific issues.
3. Study the tests to understand the expected behavior.
4. Review relevant code sections and documentation.
5. Reproduce the issue using a minimal example.
6. Formulate and test hypotheses incrementally, documenting each step.
7. Apply minimal necessary changes to fix the error once confirmed.
